"I'm a technical artist with a love for technology, games, and being creative. I love the process of creation, building, and bringing concepts from ideas into reality. I'm always striving to improve my skills, learn new techniques and technologies, and to bring my skill-set forward to achieve new heights.<br /><br />I enjoy working with like-minded people in collaborative environments and teams, but I'm also confident in my ability to be self-sufficient and work independently to complete tasks and objectives. My goal is to always bring impactful ideas and solutions to the table, and to tackle problems with creativity and dedication."
